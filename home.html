  Welcome to Life with Lee, my cozy corner of the internet where I share my mental health journey with honesty and heart. I know how
  
overwhelming and isolating it can feel to struggle with your mind - I've been there too. But I want you to know that you're not alone, 
and that there is hope for healing and happiness. Here, I'll share my stories, my struggles, and my successes, in the hopes that it 
might bring you comfort, reassurance, and inspiration to keep moving forward. Grab a cup of tea, get comfy, and let's navigate this wild
 ride called life together.Remember,You are seen, you are heard, and you are loved</p>
