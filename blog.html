<h1>WHAT INSPIRED 'LIFE WITH LEE'?</h1>
<P style="font-size: xx-large; color: rgb(39, 8, 66);">Growing up, I always viewed my self as smart, and thought that it was the only strenth that I had. I never saw myself 
  as pretty, so I was convined that being smart was all that I had. My entire world caame crashing down on me in 2022, when I recieved my first report card that ever said "not achieved"
  To many others it would seem like a smaal obstacle which could be overcome, but to me it was way more then that. I started letting it get to my head, until it reached a point where I 
  started harming myself. I spent months feeling like I was loosing myself, as everything started feeling lilke it was falling apart. This phase of my life helped me realise that mental
   health was bigger then what I always thought. I promised myself that as soon as I learn to deal with my mental health, I'd try my best to help other young girls deal with theirs.

   conversation, and every tear shed is a testament to your resilience. Don't give up, even when it feels like the journey is too long, too hard, or too lonely.You are loved,
