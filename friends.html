<h1 style="text-align: center;font-style: oblique;">LIFE STORY ABOUT FRIENDS</h1>
<p style="color: rgb(34, 4, 61); text-align: center;font-size: 25px;font-style: oblique;">I grew up in Westbury, in a neighborhood that just got tougher and rougher as I got older. I don't have many fond memories of 
kindergarten - mostly just getting bullied and trying to survive. But somehow, that experience shaped me into a bit of a bully 
myself in primary school. I was trying to protect myself, I guess. It's crazy to think about now, but that's just how it was
As I got a bit older, I started to find my footing. I made two amazing friends at the start of primary school, and they were my 
absolute rocks. We did everything together - exploring the neighborhood, playing games, getting into mischief. Those were some of 
the best times of my life, and I'll always treasure those memories.
But then high school hit, and everything changed. I started to realize that I didn't have to be that tough, defensive person anymore.
I could be genuine, be myself, and actually connect with people. That's when I met my last best friend, in first year. We were 
inseparable, and I thought that friendship would last forever. But it didn't, and when it ended, I was devastated.
After that, I swore off best friends. I didn't want to put myself through that pain again. Instead, I found a group of misfits -
 kids who were considered "trouble" by everyone else. But to me, they were the most authentic people I'd ever met. We bonded over 
 our shared outsider status, and I loved that. We didn't care what anyone else thought; we just enjoyed each other's company.
Looking back, I realize that I didn't exactly seek out older friends, but I somehow clicked with them more than people my own age. 
Maybe it was their maturity, their wisdom, or just their perspective. Whatever it was, it worked for me. And that's when I started to
 understand what real friendships were about - loyalty, trust, and being there for each other, no matter what.
course, not all my friendships ended well. Some people betrayed me, others drifted away, and a few just fizzled out. But that's 
life, right? I've learned to value the relationships I do have, to choose my friends wisely, and to be there for them, even when it's
 hard. days, I'm still figuring things out. I get hurt a lot, but I refuse to let fear dictate my connections. I've come to realize that
 I wasn't always the best friend, and sometimes, friendships just aren't meant to last. That's okay. I'm still learning, still growing,
  and still cherishing the lessons from my past.
