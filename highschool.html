        <h1 style="text-align: center;">HIGHSCHOOL</h1>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large; color: rgb(94, 11, 89)">High school can have a profound and lasting impact on many people, shaping their identities, influences, and trajectories
             in life. For some, it's a time of discovery, growth, and formation of lifelong friendships. For others, it's a period of
              struggle, self-doubt, and perseverance. The experiences, relationships, and lessons learned during these formative years
               can leave an indelible mark, influencing one's confidence, worldview, and future choices. High school can be a crucible
                where personalities are forged, passions are ignited, and the foundation for adulthood is laid. Its impact can be felt
                 long after graduation, as the memories, lessons, and scars of those pivotal years continue to shape individuals in
                  profound and unexpected ways. </p>
                  
<h1 style="text-align: center;">MY JOURNEY</h1>

                   <p style="font-size: xx-large;color: rgb(94, 11, 89) ">Grade 8 flew by in a whirlwind of achievement, culminating in the prestigious award of top student. But this triumph 
                    quickly soured in Grade 9, as my first bad report card sent me into a tailspin of self-doubt and despair. The 
            realization hit me like a ton of bricks: my entire sense of identity had been predicated on being the smart one,
                     and now that was being taken away. I felt lost and worthless, my ego shattered. In a desperate attempt to cope with 
                     the emotional pain, I turned to self-harm. But in the darkness, a glimmer of self-discovery emerged. Forced to
                      confront the void within, I began to search for a sense of self beyond the confines of academic success. It was a 
                      painful and difficult journey, but one that would ultimately lead me to a more authentic, resilient, and 
                      compassionate understanding of myself.</p>
